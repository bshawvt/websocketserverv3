		<p>This is a pet project that currently has no true goal or direction. I work on it simply for the fun of programming and to learn new things through.<br/>In a way it is my personal sandbox for ideas and miscellaneous bad experiments.</p>
		<p>Currently, you can only enjoy suffering through an endless black 3D void. For now it remains a multiplayer walking simulator.</p>
		<p>The server is run on a personal computer and therefore it is not always available or online.</p>
		<p>I use the following libraries:<br/><a href="https://threejs.org/">ThreeJS</a>  for the 3d bits, and a really neato javascript <a href="https://github.com/bitwiseshiftleft/sjcl">crypto library</a>.</p>
