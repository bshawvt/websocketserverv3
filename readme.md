### setup notes:    
 Incase a system only has a java 8 jre that doesn't have the Base64 module available there is an alternative available in the java-websockets ssl helper package.    
 
 the following build path external libraries are required in order to build and launch the server:    
 
* java-Websockets-ssl-j11-lib.jar 	
	- [export as a jar](https://bitbucket.org/bshaw/java-websocket_ssl/src/master/ "https://bitbucket.org/bshaw/java-websocket_ssl/src/master/")    
* gson-lib.jar 						
	- [export as jar](https://github.com/bshawvt/gson "https://github.com/bshawvt/gson")    
* mysql-connector-java-8.0.17.jar 	
	- [jar src](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/ "https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/") or [direct](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=490495 "https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=490495")
